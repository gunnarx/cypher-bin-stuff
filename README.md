# My Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

## Installation

Run `rake` to symlink all the files and folders into their proper places.

## A Note about Vim

You're of course welcome to use/copy any of the config stuff from my vimrc, but if you're new to vim, I would suggest you start with [Mislav MarohniÄ‡'s Vim Setup](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2011/12/vim-revisited/).

My Vim config is highly customized to my needs, and probably not well suited to a beginner

Some stuff is not from me, and without attribution, and I no longer remember where I got it from. I apologize for that.
